                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The project focused on the segmentation of high-resolution RGB satellite
                        images into land use land cover (LULC) categories using fully convolutional networks (FCN-8).</p>
                    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We employed the FCN-8 model with VGG-16 weights to semantically segment
                        images into forest, built-up, farmland, and water categories. A non-overlapping grid-based method
                        was used for training.</p>
                    <p><strong>Results:</strong> The model achieved an accuracy of 91% and an Intersection over Union (IoU)
                        of 0.84, surpassing traditional GIS software. This work enhances satellite image classification
                        accuracy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The project focused on tackling the challenge of accurately classifying and understanding the urban environment in developing countries. This research aimed to improve urban planning and management through advanced data analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We utilized deep learning models alongside a novel classification method. The approach involved combining satellite imagery and ground-based data with advanced machine learning techniques to classify various aspects of urban environments. The project leveraged tools like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and geospatial analysis to handle large-scale environmental data.</p>
                    <p><strong>Results:</strong> The project resulted in the development of a classification system capable of distinguishing different urban features with high accuracy. This has the potential to significantly improve urban infrastructure planning, reduce inefficiencies in resource allocation, and assist policymakers in better managing urban growth in developing regions.</p>
